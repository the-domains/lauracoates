Well that thing you tap into, that dream you have when your doing the thing you love or relaxing and letting your mind run free, that you is already existing.

<p>The greatness that lives in the reality of our precious minds comes into fruition when we are able to gain fidelity with our truth. It is a decision to be made; you have to want to become the person you know you can be, and you have to decide to become the person you want to be, in order for your life to evolve into a reality that caters to the unique creation that you are. Living day-to-day, wondering if you’re moving in the right direction, seeing signs that good things are coming, and hoping that it all will work out, can result in years of ups and downs, instead of the “heaven on earth” reality that you could be living. My name is Laura Coates, and I am writing this post to let you know that it is possible to live your life in a constant forward moving motion. It is possible to be present at all times, it is possible to consistently feel mentally, physically, and spiritually connected, and it’s possible to have absolutely anything your precious mind imagines for yourself. Do you want to change the culture of music to embrace a contemporary truth that is being overseen my the masses? You can do it. Do you want to unravel the hidden truths through your illustrations and attract a community around your work that supports your vision and your intention? You can do it. Do you want to be a leader into the future with a belief that holds a sacred truth based on the simple laws of the universe, all to offer others an easier life and a better way of seeing the world? You can do it. You can do anything. You have the love and support of forces far beyond our comprehension, and the people that walk this planet, hip to this knowing by even a fraction, are looking for you, and whether you realize it or not, you are looking for them too.</p><p>We are not lost. We are not found. We are maneuvering from a place in-between. Everything is constantly leading up to a more improved way of being, and the things you once believed to be impossible are now manifesting into the now. Do you want to ride the wave of expansion? Do you want to learn more about your purpose, your inner brilliance, and the ways it can work with other brilliant minds through the desire to see, hear, touch, feel, and taste more? Then make the decision to do it.</p><p>There is no other way to live besides in a state of bliss. Nothing else can compare. The torment humans face through internal battles between love and fear are becoming more and more painful to go through, because a realization is in the horizon, the realization that love is life, and fear might as well be death. Do this for your life. Do this for your happiness. Do this because this is why you are here, to live life like your life depends on it.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="85"><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="86"><h5 data-reactid="87"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="88">Laura Coates</span></h5></div></div></section></div><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="89"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="90"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="91"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="92"><span data-reactid="93"><!-- react-empty: 94 --><h2 data-reactid="95"><a data-reactid="96">lauracoates</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="97"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="98"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="99"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="100"></div></section></div></div>
