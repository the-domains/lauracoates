# What's Waiting for You

Have you ever envisioned yourself as a being a total badass, unique, mystifying, talented, tuned in human being that's creating and experiencing things that cannot be compared to anything else you have ever witnessed? I'm talking about a version of you that encompasses your entirety, a you that is maxed up to 100% on a scale of originality and badassness? Well that thing you tap into, that dream you have when your doing the thing you love or relaxing and letting your mind run free, that you is already existing. It's existing in a place we can feel, in a home that exists in your core as a human. It's your inner being, and it's excited to meet you. 

Understanding this truth is an emotional journey that leads to a decision. It is a decision between two options. 1) continue living life as you're living it, and 2) Become what your inner being already is living; aka, uniting with all that you are.
