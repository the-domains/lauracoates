# Living Life

What feels right, tight now is my bunny grass thats potted outside my window. What feels good right now is The Grid being useful. What feels good right now is doing things for myself. What feels good right now is picking up on active projects for the sake of seeing my gift, and watching it in the act of giving. 

What feels good right now is moving forwards and doing a little at a time. What feels good right now is being able to project confidence, and acceptance. What feels good right now is to do it for the children. To do it for Lilly. 

Lilliana and Marley. Making short narrative videos with them in mind.

What feels good right now is the flow of ideas coming. All being easy to access and enlivening to explore. 

What feels great is living. I love living. I love the feeling of life. I love paving out a story. I love the open vessels.

What feels good is knowing what I'm looking for in an intimate partner. Someone is an open vessel. Someone that I fall into. 

What feels good is falling into people in their heightened awareness.

What feels good is knowing that I will be exploring new people. What feels good is knowing that I like people. I like being able to meet new people and feel for our mutual sweet spot. I like being able to tune into someone for an extended period of time, and feel good throughout. I like being uplifted with a smile. I like feeling for their truth. I like asking questions and listening for where we are alike. I like to feel life. 

I love living. I want to be able to vibe until I absolutely cannot be awake any longer. I want eachday to contain experiences like nothing else I have ever had before. 

I like to know that my life in unfolding as i am. I like to know that the summoned experiences are there as a result of who I am, who I have become, and who I merging into.

Life is all inclusive. â€ o live, is to be apart of that. To see no lack in the eye of doubt, but to understand that the desire behind it will blossom into an experience like no other. 

I live for myself. I share to myself, I understand myself. 

The world outside is me. It is essentually a virtual world that reflects to me exactly what i have become, all of my traits, and all of my personality. 

It feels good to embrace me for who I am. To understand myself. To learn what needs to be done to enter into the clear way of life, the way of life I am consciously choosing to live; The Living Experience. To Live. 

I am who I am. There is plenty to discover, and plenty to feel pleased by. I like how I talk. I like how I think. I like how I socialize. I like my sense of humor. I like my state of clamness. I like my freeness. I like life. 

To live.
