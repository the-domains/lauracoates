# The Wormhole

The first time I felt the sensation of total absolute alignment, it felt like someone was pressing an imaginary acid-based sponge to my body, causing a freezing sensation to travel down the tips of my fingers, through the veins in my arms, and into my chest. It felt as though every cell in my body was opening up to its fullest capacity, and I was releasing all resistance that has ever been. I call this "the wormhole." 

When choosing to live life as an absolute, united being, your body will begin to show physical changes in order to train you for the life you are merging into. Certain foods will become more appealing than others, certain smells will become stronger, textures will hold more value, and so forth. 

Going into the wormhole is something that just happens. It is something that becomes apart of you. It is a merging and a moving into. It is a state completely open and free. It becomes more and more familiar the more time you spend within yourself. The wormhole is a place where, ultimately, you are an open vessel for your highest self to exist and create through. It is where powerful work is created. It's where brilliant ideas bleed through. It's where access to infinite knowledge is accessed.
