# Letting Go and Giving In

There is nothing more romantic than giving into the self, and letting go of the past.

To Let Go is to release all beliefs of the world outside of the offering of your pleasant now. All dreams, relationships, goals, and epiphanies are released in knowing that a continuous flow of you, of life, of love, is in the moment.

To Give In is to love without judgement, it is to give into the pull of your desire, to admit to yourself what it is that you want, to fall into yourself completely, to get glimpses of what your becoming, to see it clearly, to be pulled into another world.

Your journey is where it is. Embrace it, because it's already embracing you. Go where it feels really good. Feel good while constantly moving into what you're becoming.

The transition into your ultimate unity is something movie and novels prey on. It is an experience unlike anything else in the norms of human society. It is a perfect movement and rotation of your energy. It is a crown for you, for you have become the quessn of your own reality. It is to see the world as it is, and undertsand where your world exists vibrationally, and be excited about it. It is to know the reality that is becoming. It is to feel the pull like there is nothing else that exists. It is to emerge into yourself, to unite all that you are it is to become the ultimate version of yourself, infinitely moving into more and more. It is to appreciate growth, and to look forward to the rush associated with "resistance."

It is to love everything that is. It is to fall in like your entering weightlessness, shedding your body, moving into your body, residing here, on this earth, and consciously choosing to make it your home. It manifesting the environment around you to be exactly what you want it to be. It is to be playful. It is to see things in the upward respect. It is to make extensive eye contact when the pull is there. It is release. It is everything that you are. It seeing your potential and reality. It is to be home in your body. It is to feel the outward push of your skin as your energy completely takes residence. It is to accept the map of knowing. It is to evolve, accepting what you gave yourself. It is to understand the forces that are apart of you. It is to know that it all is coming back. They are coming into my experience because I am calling them here to create the community that I know I want to be apart of. I will be living an existence of my choice because there is no other way for me to live, other than to be alive.
